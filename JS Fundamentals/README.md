The **"JS Fundamentals"** course extends the previously gained basic coding skills from the **"Programming Basics"** course. Along with programming techniques, the course develops **algorithmic thinking** and builds **problem-solving skills** by working on hundreds of hands-on exercises. Much of the practical training in the course involves working with **linear data structures** and **word processing**. Concepts that aim to introduce students to the **core units of object-oriented programming** will also be affected. There are **two exams** in the course, the first is to test the skills of working with **basic data structures**, and the final is to test knowledge relating to slightly more complex concepts - **associative arrays** and **word processing**.
